I started by running a full NMAP port scan to look for services running on the host with belwo cmd:

** nmap -n -Pn --top-ports=2000 10.10.11.247 --reason --disable-arp-ping

Nmap scan report for 10.10.11.247
PORT   STATE SERVICE REASON

21/tcp open  ftp     syn-ack
22/tcp open  ssh     syn-ack
53/tcp open  domain  syn-ack

Then i did an nmap version scan of the services listening on the host with below command:

** nmap -n -Pn -p21,22,53 -sC -sV 10.10.11.247 --disable-arp-ping

Nmap scan report for 10.10.11.247
Host is up (0.12s latency).

-- Exploitation walkthrough:
============================
From nmap's version scan result, i could see that the FTP server allows for anonymous login which I
tried to login as.

On successfull FTP anon login, I downloaded all files. On viewing the files, i could see clear text
passwords in the etc/config/wireless and in profile/rpcd files.

Nothing this down, the .tar file i expanded, expanded to a etc folder. In the etc folder, I could 
see passwd, group files which the user 'netadmin' stood out including the root user.

Since we have two possible passwords and two possible users, I tried to login via ssh. Also in the
other files form the ftp server, I got two vallid employee emails.

The valid logincreds for the SSH service is 'netadmin' with password 'VeRyUniUqWiFIPasswrd1!'

On logging in, i got the user flag in netadmin's home folder.

Next i performed my normal post-exploitation enumeration on the host. There were no SUID files or
miscoig on passwd files so i focused on the processes running on the machine with the 'ps' cmd.

focusing on what is running on as root, i saw the 'hostapd' process running.

hostapd (host access point daemon) is a user space daemon software enabling a network interface card 
to act as an access point and authentication server.

Using the 'iwconfig' command, I could see the 'mon0' interface is used in 'monitor' mode.

Since this machie is about abusing wifi networks, I need to escalat my privs via the wifi network.

fist I enum the network interfaces on the host iwth the 'iwconfig' and 'ifconfig' cmd.

I noticed that wlan0 is the wifi AP, wlan1 is a client and mon0 is used for monitioring and testing
purpose cos it was in 'monitor' mode.

Next, I have to bruteforce the AP PIN so i can get the clear-text password/passphrase.

From one of the files downloade from the FTP server is a .txt file that indicated that the 'reaver'
tool was installed on the system and used for testng purposes.

We will use this tool to bruteforce the PIN but first, lets enum further the wireless network 
interface statistics and configs.

I used the 'iw dev' to get the above informaion for the wifi network interfaces.

Attempting to brute force the WPS PIN could potentially lead to obtaining the actual Wi-Fi
password.

To look for tools that I can use to perform network related activities I used the below command:

** getcap -r / 2>/dev/null

To run a WPS PIN attack, we require the BSSID (Basic Service Set Identifier) of the Access Point AP 

This BSSID uniquely identifies the AP, and having it allows us to target the specific AP for the 
attack.

** wash -i wlan0 or iw dev			To get BSSID (MAC addr) of the AP we want to bruteforce.
** reaver -i mon0 -b 02:00:00:00:00:00 -vv -c 1			Bruteforce the WPS PIN

output:
=======
[+] Pin cracked in 2 seconds
[+] WPS PIN: '12345670'
[+] WPA PSK: 'WhatIsRealAnDWhAtIsNot51121!'
[+] AP SSID: 'OpenWrt'
[+] Nothing done, nothing to save.

After getting the AP password, I then used it to login via SSH as the root user. This logged me in
and I then got the root flag in /root/flag.txt
